Do historical events like desecrating Hindu temples by Muslims cause more contemporary conflicts in India between Hindus and Muslims? Do they make conflicts more severe? Historical events may affect people’s incentives. Moreover, Incentives are the reasons for people’s acts like starting a conflict or participating in it. By knowing them, we can stop or mitigate the severity of a conflict. 
I use historical temple desecration data from 1192 to 1760 to investigate the effect of these desecrations on Hindu-Muslim conflicts in India in the second half of the 20th century. The results show that while these temple desecrations do not affect conflict onset, they can affect conflicts’ severity. They cause more prolonged conflict, fewer arrests and a higher casualty rate in their districts. 


In this analysis, I try to find one of the many causes of the conflicts between Hindus and Muslims in India. While in many cases, we can see that both reasons play roles in initiating a conflict, here I want to focus on the value part. 

The main goal of this analysis is to use the data from these historical temple desecrations to see how these historical events affect contemporary Hindu- Muslim conflicts. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no research tries to use the temple desecration data in India to find a link between these historical events and contemporary Hindu-Muslim conflicts. Here I try to find out are these places experience more or more severe conflicts or not?
