In this analysis, I try to find one of the many causes of the conflicts between Hindus and Muslims in India. While in many cases, we can see that both reasons play roles in initiating a conflict, here I want to focus on the value part. 

The main goal of this analysis is to use the data from these historical temple desecrations to see how these historical events affect contemporary Hindu- Muslim conflicts. To the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge, no research tries to use the temple desecration data in India to find a link between these historical events and contemporary Hindu-Muslim conflicts. Here I try to find out are these places experience more or more severe conflicts or not? 

For having access to data please contact me by my email.

If you have any further question please do not hesitate to conatac me.
